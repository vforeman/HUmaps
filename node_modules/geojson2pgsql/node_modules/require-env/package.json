  "readme": "Your env variables are dependencies. Treat them as such.\n\n# Installation\n\n`npm install require-env --save`\n\n(`--save` automatically updates your package.json file - tell your friends)\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\n\nvar env = require('require-env'),\n    foo = env.require('FOO');\n\n```\n\nIf there's a FOO variable in your app's environment, ie `process.env.FOO`, then `foo` is set. If not, then an exception is thrown and your app will crash.\n\nThis mirrors the behavior of the node.js `require` method which will crash if the given module is not found. This is especially useful on services such as Heroku which store database connection info in environment variables. If you don't have the URL for a database you require, better to crash now than to crash somewhere inside someone else's connect method.\n\n# API\n\nThis module also contains some convenience functions for dealing with environment variables in node:\n\n## env.contains(name)\n\nreturns true if `process.env[name]` exists and is not `undefined`.\n\n## env.inherit(filename)\n\nSynchronously loads environment variables of the form `KEY=VALUE` from the given file and adds them to `process.env`. Useful for running tests with different environment variables. Understands comments (lines beginning with `#`). Does not crash if the file is missing (just prints a warning). Written with [Foreman's](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) `.env` files in mind.\n\n## env.require(name)\n\nreturns the environment variable with the given `name` if it exists and is not `undefined`. Throws an Error if otherwise.\n\n## env.requireUrl(name)\n\nRuns `url.parse` on the variable with the given `name`, parses `user` and `pass` variables from any resulting `auth` info and parses any resulting `port` into an `int`. Written with RedisToGo URLs in mind.\n\n# License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2012 Bloom Studio, Inc.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
